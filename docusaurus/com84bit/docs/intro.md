# 84bit Knowledge Wiki


So much stuff is hidden away in videos, plugins, github, elsewhere. A lot of it is really quite poor at searching.
I started to pursue working on this site for a few reasons. 

While a lot of wikis have a lot of great information such as wikipedia, fandom, or other community wikis. They offer suffer from certain stylistic choices that just don't map to how my own personal mind wants to map things to. I find searching them and discovering knowledge quite slow. So 84bit is sort of an experiment to see if others find it useful or not. Otherwise, it'll stay useful for just myself.
