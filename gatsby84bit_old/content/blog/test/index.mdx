  This whole section (wrapped in `---` is called frontmatter. It is YAML-formatted information and won't be rendered
  in the preview window. The section itself and any values inside are fully optional and can be omitted.
  It can contain any keys you wish, but Deepdwn only uses the following:
  `title` if available in the file list, but will show the filename instead if you haven't added a title yet.
  `category` is a single value, used for organizing similar content together.
  `tags`, like `category` are used to group content together. Unlike `category` a document can have multiple tags.
  `dir` may be either `ltr` or `rtl` to indicate that the current document should be edited and displayed either
    left-to-right, or right-to-left

## Body Copy

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time, as she went down, to look about her. First, she tried to make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed. It was labeled "ORANGE MARMALADE," but, to her great disappointment, it was empty; she did not like to drop the jar, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.

Down, down, down! Would the fall never come to an end? There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking to herself. "Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!" (Dinah was the cat.) "I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me!" Alice felt that she was dozing off, when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.

## Lists

### Bulleted

* Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
* Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  + Marker character change forces new list start:
    - Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    - Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
* Very easy!

### Numbered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa

Automatic numbering:

1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
58. bar

## Checklists

Inline LaTeX `latex \lim_{{{N}\to\infty}}{\sum_{{{i}={0}}}^{{N}}}`

`$$` delimiters can also be used for latex blocks:

$$
{\sum_{{{i}={1}}}^{{n}}}{i}^{{3}}={\left(\frac{{{n}{\left({n}+{1}\right)}}}{{2}}\right)}^{{2}}
$$

and single `$` delimiters can be used for inline latex: ${N}\to\infty$
